Staging Site can be found at https://normalatordotcom.z16.web.core.windows.net/.
Any changes to the master branch are automatically deployed to the staging site. 

Once changes have been approved on the staging site, ask Patrick to update the live site on the server.
Do not update the live site directly! Changes will get overwritten when the next round of updates are made.
